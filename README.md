## Overview ##
This product analyzes movie release data from multiple online sournces to genreate production recommendates for the newly created Microsoft Studios. Analysis of the data focusing on Return on Investment (ROI) reveals that there are underutilized genres and lulls in the calendar that could be leveraged to create movies that maximize profit and minimize competition. 

## Business Problem ##
Microsoft has just announced the launch of Microsoft Studios and wants to ensure that their intial suite of offerings capture both the highest profit possible while standing out from other studio's offerings. Doing so will fulfill shareholder expectations and carve out a unique niche in a highly competative market. 

## Data ##
Data was gethered from IMDb, The Internet Movie Database, Box Office Mojo, and The Numbers. The genre, financial, and release information allowed for the calculation of Profit and ROI (Gross/Production Budget).

## Results ##

The genres with the greatest ROI were Horror, Thriller, and Mystery. The gap between the genre with the highest ROI and the fifth highest is much more significent then the the gap between the top genre and the twentieth.

Looking at what other studios were making the Thriller genre was the most popular genre, with the greatest ROI, that other top studios weren't making.

The number of movies released by studio trends upwards over the course of the year, noticably picking up for the summer blockbuster season and peaking in November as movies release films for consideration in the next year's award season.

Examining the top three genres by ROI you see that they mirror the overall release trend for the latter half of the year.  From January to May there are far fewer releases with a dip accross genres in April and May.

## Conclusions ##
Microsoft Studio can leverage the analysis perfomed by taking the following recommendations for their initial suite of releases:

- As a new production company, Microsoft should focus on the best return for their investment. This will ensure revenue for future products.

- Direct competition with established studios should focus on the Thriller genre.

- The release schedule should take advantage of end of year and late spring lulls in order to maximize visibility of product. Limited competition requires decreased marketing budget for these offerings (aka the Deadpool scenario). 
## Next Steps ##

Further analysis should focus on the following data-points in order to further refine Microsoft Studio's production plans to maximize Return on Investment:

- Examine hybrid genres to see where their trends lay – e.g. horror/comedy or war/musical

- Dig into which directors’ films have the best ROI to hire the most efficient filmmakers.

- Examine ticket sales number to see which genres get people into the theater.
